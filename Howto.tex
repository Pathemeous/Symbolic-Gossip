To generate the PDF, open \texttt{report.tex} in your favorite \LaTeX editor and compile.
Alternatively, you can manually do
\texttt{pdflatex report; bibtex report; pdflatex report; pdflatex report} in a terminal.

You should have stack installed (see \url{https://haskellstack.org/}) and
open a terminal in the same folder.

\begin{itemize}
  \item To compile everything: \verb|stack build|.
  \item To open ghci and play with your code: \verb|stack ghci|
  \item To run the executable from Section \ref{sec:Main}: \verb|stack build && stack exec myprogram|
  \item To run the tests from Section \ref{sec:simpletests}: \verb|stack clean && stack test --coverage|
\end{itemize}
