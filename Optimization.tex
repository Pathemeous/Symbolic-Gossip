\section{Optimization}\label{sec:Optimization}

We will now look at improving the runtime of the synchronous case.

As mentioned before, the classical transformer defined in \cite{GattingerThesis2018}
involves a considerable amount of inserted propositions and extensions of the state law.

This is further worsened by the nature of the gossip problem:
both the event propositions (the calls) and the secret atoms grow rapidly as the number of agents increases.
Moreover, the statelaw encodes all of the secret atoms.

The route of optimization therefore seems to be in limiting the amount of proposition insertions.
We show two methods do that: using a optimization function to trim redundant propositions,
and a different notion of transformer that avoids copying alltogether.
