\subsection{Transformer Tests}
We use the following functions (previously defined in \cite{GattingerThesis2018}) concerning experts\footnote{An expert is an
agent who knows all secrets, that is, \texttt{expert n a} is defined as
$\bigwedge \{S_a b\mid b\in [1,...,n]\}$},
which define the formulas "agent a is an expert" and "all agents are experts".

\begin{showCode}
    expert :: Int -> Int -> Form
    expert n a = Conj [ PrpF (hasSof n a b) | b <- gossipers n, a /= b ]

    allExperts :: Int -> Form
    allExperts n = Conj [ expert n a | a <- gossipers n ]

    isSuccess :: Int -> [(Int,Int)] -> Bool
    isSuccess n cs = evalViaBdd (after n cs) (allExperts n)

    isSuccessTransparent :: Int -> [(Int,Int)] -> Bool
    isSuccessTransparent n cs = evalViaBdd (afterTransparent n cs) (allExperts n)

    isSuccessSimple :: Int -> [(Int,Int)] -> Bool
    isSuccessSimple n cs = evalViaBdd (afterSimple n cs) (allExperts n)
\end{showCode}
